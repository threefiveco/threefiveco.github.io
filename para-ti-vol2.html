							<p>The second volume to <i>Para Ti</i>, the playlist I used to show you how much you mean to me. Volume II is meant to do the same now that we've (temporarily) parted ways. Here's a breakdown to each song and why it means something to us. I'm sorry I know that this list looks kind of awkward. I'm still learning how to do this lol.</p>

                            <p>I still remember the first time I heard this song with you. We were driving early in the morning, I think back to Buffalo, and you started playing this along some Beyonce songs. I remember hearing the lyrics and relating so much in the moment. I wasn't sure if you were singing to me but I know now that you were. That was the day I understood your struggle. I understood you weren't trying to hurt me. You were just stuck in the middle of a very difficult situation. </p>

                            <p>Oh man. This song. Literally made for us. I don't remember exactly when we heard this but if my memory doesn't fail me I think I showed you this song. I remember that when we "discovered" it you replayed this like 100 times in a day. I did the same. Every time I hear this song no matter what or when it will always remind me of you. It was basically made for us.</p>

                            <p>I remember one day I asked you to show me some new music. I guess we hadn't really shared much music with each other. You showed me Steve Lacey's songs. You showed me this one, <i>Dark Red</i>, and I think <i>Some</i>. This is probably one of the biggest gifts in terms of music you've ever given me. In fact I remember loving his vibe instantly.</p>

                            <p>This song. This fucking song!!! I remember so clearly it was the summer of 2017. I had just had that huge fight with my grandparents and I was living at my aunt's apartment. My aunt had gone to Colombia so I had the apartment to myself. I replayed this on the speakers like 20 times while I showered and got ready. It's funny because we also broke up around that time. We've been trying to do this for so long lol.</p>

                            <p>One of our last smoke dates. That's when I showed you this song. We parked in your favorite parking lot. The one where we used to meet up with Noah to cop. You were (as usual) complaining about the fact that I never update your playlists. So I showed you this song because it meant a lot to me growing up. The fact that you liked it proves to me you're the one.</p>

                            <p>Lmao. What a weekend. Was it even on a weekend? You showed me this song on the drive back from the Poconos. You watched me react to it and were so happy because I reacted the same way you did the first time you heard it. That was such a fun weekend with you. I don't think I'll ever forget how you were telling me that the asian masseuse was working your back like you owed her money. Funiest shit ever. Oh and the nails people making fun of us. And the guy that made fun of the Prius and asked to race. Oh and watching Black Panther!</p>

                            <p>So, this song came out a little ago. I first shared this album with you on a road trip. I can't remember exactly which road trip but I'm pretty sure we were in Rochester. We went to say hi to Ajanee and forgot to say hi to Mehrose or something like that. Or we met up with her in a parking lot. It's kind of hazy for me. Anyway, the time it really stuck with us was also coming back from Pocono, NJ. I remember we were listening to the <i>N.E.R.D</i> album and I asked you to play this after. It was just a similar vibe. That's why this is right after <i>Kites</i> on the playlist.</p>
                            
                            <p><b>8. Get You - Daniel Ceasar</b></p>

                            <p>Honestly I don't remember when we first heard this. You probably showed it to me being a Daniel Caesar song and all. I'm pretty sure this is on your Cherry Blossom playlist. I do remember it being a song you listen to, and also that the lyrics literally speak to me. This is another one of those songs that will always remind me of you. I mean all of these probably will but I think this one is just one of those where the lyrics are exactly how I feel about you.</p>

                            <p>This song doesn't really have such a significant background to us (compared to the others), but honestly we both vibed so much to <i>DAMN.</i> and this is just one of those songs that play in the background of my mind whenever I'm looking at you or making out with you.</p>
                            
                            <p><b>10. Saved - Khalid</b></p>

                            <p>Damn. This song. Right in the feels. I'd just landed at JFK and opened spotify because I was feeling really down. This was when you ghosted me while I was abroad. I remember thinking I would never see you again. I deleted all of your pictures from my phone. This song was exactly how I was feeling at the time and I played it on repeat until I got home. That was a tough week for both of us.</p>

                            <p>SZA's album came out around Ajanee's birthday. We were driving down to Rochester because you'd promised to see her. This song just hits me in the feels. I remember showing you the music video to this and your reaction. Shit was priceless. </p>

                            <p>"ALLE PLEASE PLAY THE ONE WITH THE VOCALS! AT LEAST PLAY IT RIGHT AFTER THIS ONE" Lmao. I will always remember asking you that every time this song comes on and you not doing it. Then showing you the one with the vocals and you telling me you like this version better. Ugh.I love you lol.</p>

                            <p>I showed you this song when we were in Buffalo driving around at 4am. I am almost certain you were driving. I was exhausted but you wanted to go around the block a couple of times before we went back to my apartment. You loved this song when I played it and you played it on repeat until I couldn't take it any more and told you we needed to go back. LMAO those were the days.</p>

                            <p>This song is the whole reason for me making this list in the first place. I had this idea the day you showed me this song. We were driving to watch the sunset. We were just chilling in that parking lot in one of your favorite spots. I remember thinking I never wanted to forget that moment. The beautiful sunset, the vibes this song gave me, sitting next to you in that car. We were just enjoying existance. I've always wanted someone to be able to do that with. That moment I realized I finally had that.</p>

                            <p>I don't know if you remember this moment but we were driving to Nick's friend's house. It was super dark and the highway was so narrow but this song was playing. I'm pretty sure I played it like three times. It's also Kali Uchis whom we both love. This song is on this playlist because I remember that moment every time I hear it and you were there for that. </p>

Deadass would play this every other song. When I first heard it I remember I was like "OMG Drake sampled this" and you were like "yeah... duh..." But yeah this song just reminds me of you and I like to imagine you slow dancing to me while I'm sitting on a chair lol.</p>

I don't have a particular moment that I remember with this song but I do remember you playing it so many times.</p>
                            
                            <p><b>22. Girl - The Internet</b></p>

                            <p>This song reminds me of you showing your dad new Hip-Hop music and him liking it. Another group you showed me. I feel like all the good music I listen to is thanks to you lol.</p>
                            
                            <p><b>23. She's Mine Pt. 1 - J.Cole</b></p>

                            <p>Finally a song / artist you didnt show me. I remember when this came out I put both part one and two in a playlist. I would listen to it in Buffalo on repeat whenever I missed you. This song also reminds me of your dad. You told me he heard this album and he cried. I really love your dad so much. I hope he knows that. I hope you know how much you mean to me Alle. I miss you a lot. I need these years to go by as quickly as possible. I'm sorry for sprinkling my sadness in this playlist breakdown. This song just hits me in my feels every time I hear it. It's so real to me.</p>
                            
                            <p><b>24. See You Again - Tyler, The Creator</b></p>

                            <p>Another Tyler song. This is another song that will always remind me of you. The lyrics just speak to me. It's how I feel about not seeing you. Thank you for giving me the vinyl to this too. Also typing this out reminded me of that one time we were talking about record players and you pronounced vinyl "vinil" LMAO I remember thinking "damn she's been saying it wrong her whole life" :) I love you.</p>

                            <p>Although it wasn't the first time we heard it, this song will always remind me of us in that hotel in Pocono, NJ. I remember playing this for you and you liking it. This song was actually going to go on the first <i>Para Ti</i> playlist but at the time you said you didn't like it. Then I remember you saying you fucked with it and I was like "what you deadass said to me you hate this." Good times.</p>

                            <p>I showed you this song because the lyrics are saying exactly how I feel about you. <i>"Por ti, todo lo que hago lo hago por ti. Es que tu me sacas lo mejor de mi. Soy todo lo que soy, porque tu eres todo lo que quiero."</i>  That means: For you, everything I do, I do for you. You bring out the best in me. I am all I am, because you are all I want. Also I showed it to you because he kills himself at the end and I used to think that was edgy lol.</p>

                            <p>We were in your car and you asked me to play you a spanish song that reminded me of you. After thinking for a couple of minutes I told you I had something in mind but it was kind of too feel-y. You said it didn't matter. I played this. You said this was exactly what you wanted.</p>

                            <p><i>"Bob who?"</i> LMAO. I remember finding out you didn't know who Bob Marley was. Made my day. I love you. This song is my favorite Bob song and I showed it to you driving towards the smoke spot that day. I'd shown it to you before but this was the time it kind of stuck for you. You really liked the lyrics.</p>

                            <p>Missy Elliot will always remind me of you. Picking you up from Nassau with Mehrose. Driving into the city. Whatever the occasion you always vibe to this. That's why this is here. I didn't want this playlist to be <i>too</i> sad. I wanted you to be able to listen to it and enjoy it and feel happy.</p>

                            <p>So many reasons for this to be here. It's one of those songs you vibe so hard to. It has Vince Staples (you put me on). It's so much fun. I just always think of you just dancing in the passanger seat to this. You would usually play this after or before the first Flume song on this playlist.</p>

                            <p><i>"Isn't this song on FIFA?"</i> LMAO I was so mad when you said that. I thought this song was so hard and when I showed it to you, you immediately shit on it. I know you came around and you fuck with it now. It also reminds me of Calima. Chilling outside with my friends listening to this, and recording everyone inside because it looked like they were dancing to this.</p>

                            <p>Prototype. You don't remember me showing you this song. I shared it with you because Frank Ocean samples it. It's on here because the instrumental is what it feels like to be with you and stare at the stars.</p>

                            <p>So many reasons for this to be on here. This album came out the day we were flying to San Fransisco. I remember playing this on repeat during the whole trip. It just brings me back to being in your Dad's apartment getting ready to go out. We weren't exactly on good terms, but I was still with you. This is also the song that starts playing every time I get into your car. And I also will always remember the one time when we just left it on for like an hour at night after watching the sunset.</p>
                            
                            <p>Well that's that. My first playlist breakdown. That actually took a lot more time than I thought it would, but I really enjoyed doing this. I hope you like it too. I love you with all my heart. </p>
